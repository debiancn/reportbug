reportbug (3.18) unstable; urgency=high

  * The proper SMTP setting for reporting bugs to Debian without a working
    local mailer has changed to 'bugs.debian.org'.  reportbug will noisily
    override any .reportbugrc settings for the old mail relay... however,
    you would be best advised to update .reportbugrc files accordingly.

reportbug (2.47) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The dependency relationships between reportbug and Python's locale
    support modules have changed in this version of reportbug:
  
    . python2.3-iconvcodec is now a Recommendation.
    . python2.3-cjkcodec is now recommended as an alternative.
  
    Users of Unicode (UTF-*), ISO-8859-*, and KOI8 locales may use
    reportbug without either module installed.  These encodings are
    supported by the base install of Python 2.3.
    
    Users of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean-language locales who do not use
    a UTF encoding should use python2.3-cjkcodec.
  
    Users of other locales should use python2.3-iconvcodec.
  
  * In addition, reportbug will now issue a warning on startup if the
    encoders installed on your system are insufficient for encoding the
    character set used by your locale.  (Previously, this would lead to a
    mysterious crash with a "LookupError" later in the reporting process.)
