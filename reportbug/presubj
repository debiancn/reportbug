Common issues with reportbug:

EXIM IS CONFIGURED FOR LOCAL DELIVERY: In Debian 4.0 (etch) and later,
   exim4 is configured by default to only deliver email to addresses
   on your system.  YOUR BUG REPORTS WILL NOT ARRIVE AT THE BUG
   TRACKING SYSTEM UNLESS YOU FOLLOW ONE OF THE FOLLOWING STEPS, either:

   - Reconfigure exim (using 'dpkg-reconfigure -plow exim4') to send
     mail to the Internet directly or via a smarthost.

   - Configure reportbug to deliver mail to your ISP's smarthost or
     bugs.debian.org directly (using 'reportbug --configure').

EMAIL ADDRESS SETTING: See the manual page reportbug(1) for how to set
   your email address (i.e. the address that appears in the "From:"
   header), if reportbug is unable to correctly figure it out for you.

   Note that some mail systems will further rewrite the address
   displayed by reportbug when it starts.

EDITORS: See the manual page reportbug(1) for how to choose an editor.
   You probably will want to have this setting for other tools as
   well.  As an alternative, some mail programs, such as "mutt", can
   be configured to be used as the editor for your report, which you
   may find preferable.
