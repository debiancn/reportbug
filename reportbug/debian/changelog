reportbug (3.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "widows and orphans" release (aka hopefully the last release
    before I start hacking on reportbug 4).
  * Use mbox format when accessing the Debian BTS.  This will hopefully
    avoid breakage due to presentation changes--at least for report pages;
    summary pages are a different story.  (Closes: #322720 et al.)

reportbug (3.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Respect Bccs when using MTAs and MUAs; note that broken MUAs may fail
    to suppress the Bcc field when they send, and that's not my
    problem--blame the MUA author.  However, this code works around broken
    MTAs.  Note that smtphost behavior was correct in 3.8.

    attachment can't be included in the outgoing message.
    (Closes: #226729, #265112)

    uninstalled packages (although I can't completely confirm it fixes the
    problem reported since the submitter foolishly removed the name of the
    package that he had a problem with from his report).

    (Main advantage: --bts=ubuntu works now.  If someone will kindly tell
    me an easy way to tell a Ubuntu system from a Debian one, I will
    incorporate code to eliminate the need for the forked package.  Same
    goes for any other Debian fork, BTW...)

  * The "why the f*ck isn't the Internet 8-bit clean by now?" release.
  * I think I've worked around the QP problems by forcing the body to not
    be encoded and then munging the charset header to the one appropriate
    for your locale.  If your MTA doesn't like this, get a better MTA.
    It's 2003 already.  BTW, your MTA (or someone else's) may decide to
    QP-encode the message anyway just to be friendly.  (Closes: #198663)
  * As a side effect while debugging, I also fixed a crasher where your
    locale says you're in us-ascii but you decide to put 8-bit chars in
    your headers just for entertainment value.  Fallback on iso-8859-15
    (aka Latin9 or "iso-8859-1 with the euro"), since that's as good a
    guess as any these days.  But you really should set your locale...

    Issue a stern warning if you try to file a report on a version of a
    package that isn't yet in Debian *cough* X4.3.  (Closes: #194615)
  * Add option for "completely stupid smtphost mode" in the initial

    which should enable bug reporting from even the most basic system.
    This path will also allow configuring the smtphost setting.

reportbug (2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship a fixed email module.  "Fixed" is defined as "generates stuff
    crappy MUAs and the BTS can handle", not "generates stuff that is
    RFC-compliant."  In its defense, the old code generates legal messages
    (although you wouldn't believe it from the raw output).

    + Do not, under any circumstances, base64-encode message bodies, no
      matter what character set is claimed.  (Closes: #165356, #165498)
    + Do not, under any circumstances, base64-encode message headers.
    + Do not QP-encode headers unless they contain special characters or
      exceed line-length limitations.
    + Still QP-encode message bodies, since nobody's complained about
      that yet.

  * More bugs like these and I'm going to Conflict with python 2.2.2 (or

reportbug (1.99.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload of reportbug 2 to unstable, since woody is now fully
    frozen.  Now requires Python 2.2.  (Closes: #127716)
    + This introduces a priority imbalance bug in unstable.  Since Python
      >= 2.2 will be the default Python for woody+1, this is a temporary
      situation.
    + Please see the changelog entries through 1.99.0 for changes from 1.50.
    + Various items were marked as fixed in experimental.
      (Closes: #113284, 135704)
  * Removed debugging info from output when using debsums.
  * Use full path when calling debsums.
  * Fix a buglet that left sendto unset.
  * Fix a bug in the bug script when .reportbugrc is not empty.
  * You now can only select each tag once.  (Closes: #146156)
    (Implemented in the text UI: ui.select_multiple)
  * Menu prompts are now displayed when stdout is redirected.
    (Closes: #145936)
  * Check packages.debian.org in addition to the status database when
    filing an ITP/RFP, as the status database may include false positives
    when the package is built locally but not in Debian.  (Closes: #146614)

reportbug (1.99.16) experimental; urgency=low

  * --configure didn't work in .15; fixed.
  * Relax the justification check for serious bugs.  (Closes: #144803)
  * Ignore $TMPDIR if it isn't a valid directory.  (Closes: #144472)
  * Note that LC_CTYPE is overridden by LC_ALL in Locale settings section.
    (The output was correct, as interpreted by libc.)  (Closes: #141610)
  * Added debsums support; enabled in the distributed reportbug.conf.
    (Closes: #142334)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Apr 2002 21:39:06 -0500

reportbug (1.99.15) experimental; urgency=low

  * Integrated latest GNOME patch from Robin Putters.
    + Minor reworking to change ui.EXCEPTION into EXCEPTION.
    + Backed out the move of ui.handle_bts_query().  The GNOME frontend
      will need its own query routine.  For now, it raises NotImplemented.
  * debconf-show output will be included if available.  (See #142593)
  * Cleaned up the address rewriting stuff.
  * Massively sped up reportbug.get_package_info() by combining 2*DEPS
    regexps into 2 regexps.  This speeds up reporting a bug on "lsb" by
    almost a minute on a PIII-450.
  * Rewrote the option parser to use Optik.  The main user-visible effect
    is that reportbug --help is now a lot more useful.
  * Defined a new ui entry point: select_multiple.  It should allow the
    user to select multiple, nonexclusive options and return a list of the
    selected options.  (Currently not implemented in any ui module, but
    eventually will be used for tags.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Apr 2002 04:26:07 -0500

reportbug (1.99.14) experimental; urgency=low

  * Updates from 1.50
  * You can now report bugs in "kernel-image" and it will show a list of
    packages to choose from.  (This is the normal virtual package
    behavior, but I had to do some work to make it function because
    kernel-image is in the menu.)
  * Minor code cleanups to get some lines < 80 chars.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Apr 2002 08:47:13 -0600

reportbug (1.99.13) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix source queries when the source package and binary package are the
    same (in this case, src_package is not set).
  * Cleanup wording of the "new release" message.
  * Add debian-policy to the virtual packages list.  (Closes: #139970)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Apr 2002 22:35:35 -0600

reportbug (1.99.12) experimental; urgency=low

  * Query on source packages when searching for bugs in the BTS by
    default.  (Closes: #138928)
  * Any editor that has "emacs" in its name will now jump to a line number;
    this avoids needing to add emacs32 when it comes out...
  * Broke up the bug handling script into a script and a presubj.
  * Include user configuration file in reports on reportbug.
  * Converted ui.select_options(message, 'yn'...) to
    ui.yes_no(message...); this will help make non-text UIs cleaner, and
    may eventually aid i18n support.  (This also cleaned up a lot of
    superfluous temporary variables in the code.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Mar 2002 23:32:33 -0600

reportbug (1.99.11) experimental; urgency=low

reportbug (1.99.10) experimental; urgency=low

reportbug (1.99.9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Integrated changes from 1.46-1.47.
  * Added support for a "virtual" severity: does-not-build
  * Check buildd.debian.org for does-not-build bugs.  (Closes: #137607)
  * Changed maintonly default to no on wishlist/minor bugs.
  * Some wnpp bugs don't require BTS queries.  (Closes: #138071)

reportbug (1.99.7) experimental; urgency=low

  * Removed debugging output from urllib calls.
  * Fixed calls to ewrite() in querybts

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Mar 2002 22:09:02 -0600

reportbug (1.99.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * reportbug 1.99.5 implemented the option of sending a report directly
    to the maintainer if the package was not found in the BTS; I forgot to
    mention it in the changelog.  Mea culpa.  (See #135704, #135710;
    already closed.)
  * Include GNOME interface patch from Robin Putters, and add some
    work-arounds to the code to handle GNOME nicely.
  * Ripped out the urllib code and replaced it with urllib2 code.  This
    makes proxy authentication work in some circumstances, but it still
    needs additional work, particularly with bad proxy servers.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Mar 2002 02:21:40 -0600

reportbug (1.99.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Checking for new versions can be disabled using --no-check-available
    or the parallel config option.
  * Added reportbug_exceptions.py for UI exception definitions.
  * Cull duplicate entries in the dependency output when both a real
    package and a virtual that is provided by that package exist.
    (e.g. packages with exim | mail-transport-agent no longer list exim
    twice if you have it installed.)

  * Fix postinst script (it tried to use python1.5,2.1).
  * Integrated changes from 1.43.
  * Tab completion of bug numbers is now supported in the text interface.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Feb 2002 12:28:06 -0600

reportbug (1.99.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Beginning of reportbug 2.0 rewrite.
  * Partially rewritten in Python 2.2 syntax.  More to come, no doubt.
  * Modules moved to /usr/share/reportbug to better comport with Debian's
    Python policy.
  * Cleaned up installation of Python modules.
  * Added operating mode support (expert/novice/standard).  (Closes: #121434)
  * First-time configuration added.  (Closes: #118176)
  * Don't worry, I'm working my way through the wishlist...

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Feb 2002 03:31:42 -0600

reportbug (1.42) unstable; urgency=medium

  * I give up on sqrt(2)...
  * Wishlist items from here out will only be implemented in the
    (not-yet-released) experimental branch.
  * WNPP support now works with source and unknown packages.  (Closes: #131765)
  * No longer prompt when the subject was generated by the WNPP support.
    (Closes: #131100)
  * Silly me forgot that string.strip() gets rid of leading whitespace, so
    my implementation of #131472 didn't work.  Now it does, and it's been
    tested.  (Closes: #131472)
  * The mutt message has been defanged (for most, at least).  Subsequent
    reports of this issue will be merged with #131100.  You have been warned.
  * Added a diagnostic routine, per README.developers spec.
    (It also shows how to write one in something other than bash.)

reportbug (1.41.1421356) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use $EDITOR in preference to $VISUAL.  (Closes: #131610)
    This makes reportbug act like the man page claims it does.
  * Back off a bit on #131100, due to popular demand.  Just checking to
    see if anyone is actually using these packages...
  * Fix WNPP support to use source packages, not binary packages, when
    orphaning or RFA'ing a package.  (Closes: #131471)
  * Include the full description of an WNPP'd package.  (Closes: #131472)
  * Modified the prompt when the BTS browser is in standalone mode.
    (Closes: #129732)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Jan 2002 21:41:46 -0600

reportbug (1.41.142135) unstable; urgency=low

  * It'd be nice if this were the last release for woody...
  * Handle .'s in the realname part of addresses correctly, as
    rfc822.quote() doesn't seem to work right.  (Closes: #127637)
  * Add message warning certain users not to attach stuff in external
    programs until debbugs is fixed to handle MIME correctly, at which
    time this message will look incredibly stupid.  "Fixes" my part of
    #131100 ("Chris should never have let people edit messages in programs
    that can attach MIME, and therefore is responsible for problems in
    debbugs.").  Alternate solution: disable --mutt.  Y'alls' choice.
  * Update copyright year in modified files.
  * Warn if subject > 60 characters.  (Closes: #129099)
  * Added security.debian.org to valid pseudopackages.  (Closes: #129889)
  * Warn if run with uid < 500.  (Closes: #128936)
    (I chose 500 since systems converted from other distributions may have
    real users with IDs >= 500.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Jan 2002 17:41:41 -0600

reportbug (1.41.14213) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "hopefully we won't run out of double precision in sqrt(2)" release.
  * Work around lack of socket.fqdn() in Python 1.5.2 by swiping the
    routine from Python 2.1+ and backporting.  This only affects systems
    that didn't have a valid /etc/mailname, and thus would have died
    running reportbug (< 1.41.14) anyway. (Closes: #126867)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Dec 2001 00:38:18 -0800

reportbug (1.41.1421) unstable; urgency=low

  * Document template option.  (Closes: #124258)
  * Remove python-base from dependencies.  (Closes: #124014)
  * Help and version output now go to stdout.  (Closes: #124260)
  * Menu entries are now numbered in the text UI.  (Closes: #123975)
  * Bugs can be selected by a short number from the text BTS browser.
    (Closes: #118333)
  * Check /etc/email-addresses for an email address, if available.
  * Allow $DEBFULLNAME as an alternative for $DEBNAME.
  * If /etc/mailname doesn't exist, use socket.getfqdn() instead.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Dec 2001 22:47:34 -0600

reportbug (1.41.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added option '--template'.  (Closes: #123467)
  * Don't edit subject lines specified on the command line.
  * Search all packages, not just installed ones, when reporting a bug in a
    source package.  (Closes: #123672)

reportbug (1.41) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ok, maybe we'll try a fourth crack.
  * Started a CVS repository for future development.  One of these decades
    I'll figure out enough CVS to actually maintain this branch with it
    too...
  * Followup-For now recognized as a pseudoheader.
    (Closes: self-discovered-bug)
  * Warn when the severity is downgraded by the severity lameness filter.
    (Closes: #122962)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Dec 2001 02:49:05 -0600

reportbug (1.40) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Third crack at a final woody release.  The 1.x series will approach
    sqrt(2) asymptotically from here out.
  * Cleaned up .reportbugrc handling code even more.  As a bonus, 'bts'
    finally works as a config file option...
  * Suppress stderr diagnostics from dpkg --search.
  * Fix severity specification in rc files, for real this time.  A silly
    thinko was stopping it from working.  (Closes: #122539)
  * Fix crash when --file is specified and not found.  Also a side-effect
    of implementing #121707.  (Closes: #122648)
  * Explicitly warn the user that temporary files might be located in
    temporary directories, and thus might not persist.  (Closes: #122652)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Dec 2001 02:52:12 -0600

reportbug (1.39) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix stupidity in implementation of #121707.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  2 Dec 2001 15:01:25 -0600

reportbug (1.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Probably the last release for woody... see if you can break this one.
  * Upload of NMU of newt fixed problems with python-newt.
    (Closes: #119815, #120245)
  * Don't crash when severity is specified in .reportbugrc.
    (Closes: #121380)
  * Fix crasher in querybts -w introduced in 1.36.  (Closes: #121799)
  * If the specified package name looks like a filename, act like -f was
    specified.  (Closes: #121707)
  * You can now specify an editor with --editor (-e) or in .reportbugrc.
    (Closes: #121736)
  * Include a slightly-modified copy of bug's README.developers, to better
    document the per-package hook options.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Nov 2001 17:28:21 -0600

reportbug (1.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle Justification: serious better.  (Closes: #120631)
  * If a package name is Provided by another package on the system, and not
    installed itself, allow the user to select amongst the packages
    Providing it.  (For example, you can do "reportbug fetchmail" even if
    fetchmail-ssl is installed.)  (Closes: #121054)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Nov 2001 01:47:26 -0600

reportbug (1.36) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "reportbug has fan mail" release (see this week's LWN Letters page).
  * Work around #119815 by conflicting with python-newt 0.50.17-7.1.
  * In some weird situations, reportbug could bomb out with an exception
    if no package was specified.  (Closes: #119853)
  * The unversioned recommendation for python-newt is deliberate.
    This way an upgraded reportbug should work safely on a
    partially-upgraded potato system.  (Closes: #119142)
    (No python >> 1.5 features will be used until reportbug 2.0.)
  * Added source report support to querybts and reportbug.
    Use querybts --source or select a source package in reportbug.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Nov 2001 20:41:39 -0600

reportbug (1.35) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix postinst to compile on Python 2.1 systems.  (Closes: #118574)

reportbug (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * New option: --mta.  Allows you to specify an alternate path for a
    sendmail clone; it must accept standard sendmail options.
    (Closes: #116751)
  * Don't clear the screen in querybts if using the text ui.
  * reportbug will run with any version of Python in the archive; however,
    there doesn't seem to be a clean way to handle this yet.  For now,
    depend on python1.5-base | python-base (<< 2.1) until this gets
    straightened out.
  * Downgraded python-newt to a (very strong) recommendation, since
    querybts can run without it.
  * Removed reference to Progeny Debian in the description.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Oct 2001 21:21:13 -0500

    (Closes: #114100)
  * Fix bug in reporting bugs in source packages.  (Closes: #114485)
  * You can now force reporting a bug in a source package, though
    generally most bugs should be reported against binary packages.
  * Changed Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep.  (Fixes lintian
    warning.)
  * Updated to DH_COMPAT=3.

  * Corrected previous changelog entry's reference to the subject
    prepending code's ID number.

  * The "why can't Sony make a laptop keyboard that lasts more than six
    months?" release.

  * Followups no longer prompt for tags.
  * Include package and version number in followups.  (Closes: #105813)
  * Better error message when you enter a bug number not listed.
    Note that you can enter any bug number at the "more info" prompt; this
    difference is intentional.  (Closes: #105929)
    (See #103398 for the rationale for this behavioral deviation.)
  * Improved error recovery.  (Closes: #106207)
  * Bug reports will now be written to $TMPDIR by default instead of
    /var/tmp, if necessary.
  * You can now write '-T none' (or --tags=none) to bypass the tags prompt
    entirely.

reportbug (1.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * The root URL for the Debian BTS's CGI scripts has changed.  This
    probably breaks the version in stable horribly, so I may backport a
    fix for proposed-updates.  (Closes: #86032)
  * Rename 'helixcode' to 'ximian'; keep 'helixcode' as an alias for the
    Ximian bug tracking system.

reportbug (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "wait until a good version is in testing before breaking
    everything horribly" release.
  * User interface abstraction in progress... this version may be slightly
    more unstable than usual.  Currently installs reportbug_ui_text
    (working) and reportbug_ui_newt (not fully working for reportbug,
    but used by querybts).
  * For kicks, try querybts --ui=text.  If it breaks, both pieces are yours.
  * Remove dependency on whiptail; all querybts dialogs are now handled by
    python-newt.
  * Improvements in screen handling in querybts.  This should resolve the
    remaining issues with #82895.  (Closes: #82895)
  * Fix skip command in the reportbug browser when there is more than one
    page of bugs in the same category.  (Closes: #84327)
  * Looking at individual bug reports in reportbug now works a bit
    differently; you are now prompted if you want to give more info and
    can launch a browser to look at that bug.  (To put it another way: the
    functionality of querybts is merged in, even in text mode.  UI
    abstraction is our friend.)  Downside: a few more keypresses to look
    at lots of reports.
  * You can now quit while looking at a report in querybts.  (Closes: #62614)
  * redisplay now shows the last screenful, not just min(last_screenful,
    last_category).  Someone complained about this in an already-closed
    report (in addition to the main issue, which was resolved elsewhere).
  * Don't clear the screen in querybts if it exits without an exception.
  * pgp/gpg signing now omits the pseudoheaders from the signed section.
  * Report numbers with a leading # now really work in querybts.  Note that
    you'll have to escape (or quote) the # in many shells...
  * Remove some cruft from the source tree.
  * Incorporated support for the Progeny BTS.  Queries are not available
    (I have not written a GNATS query module), but report submission is.
  * -C command line option incorporated to specify the class of the report
    for gnats servers.
  * -S command line option allows either gnats or debbugs severities.
    These are mapped transparently to the severity appropriate for the
    specified BTS (i.e. wishlist on debbugs becomes non-critical for
    gnats; non-critical for gnats becomes normal for Debian).
  * The --bts option now overrides whatever's detected from the package
    info.  However, bts options in the rc files will not override that
    setting.  This seems like a reasonable default so Origin makes sense
    on Debian forks, who can set /etc/reportbug.conf to point to their BTS.
  * Updated TODO list to add some things that have been kicking around in
    my head.
  * If multiple packages match a file requested by the -f option, list the
    first 3 matching files for each package.
  * Old --quiet is now --report-quiet; removed short option.
  * New --quiet suppresses diagnostic output to stderr; nothing except
    prompts should be written to the screen by reportbug when this flag is
    specified.  Primarily for UI testing.
  * reportbug now has special prompt support for particular packages.
    This is particularly useful with pseudopackages like wnpp, wherein the
    severity of the report should be based on the subject (and the subject
    should include certain keywords).  (Note that this is different from
    the "included in package" prompt support, which has been supported for
    some time.)  Try reporting a wnpp bug to see what it does... who
    knows, you may even like it ;-)
  * Updated priority to 'standard'.

reportbug (1.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix -B option when a package's status is not queried by reportbug.
    (Closes: #83552)
  * Somewhat better handling of bogus $http_proxy settings.  reportbug and
    querybts still fail with an exception, but it gives a hint why.  Also
    document the syntax even more explicitly in the man pages.  (Closes: #83301)
  * You can now do 'querybts #82843' (allowing a leading #).  (Closes: #82843)
  * If you're running querybts under Python 2.x, use the webbrowser module
    instead of our own internal logic.  (Closes: #83545)
  * Handle missing reports more gracefully.  (Closes: #83579)
  * List all addresses a report is sent to, not just those specified on the
    command line.  (Closes: #81609)
  * If you request more info on a bug, $PAGER will be used.
    (Closes: #82791, #48328)
  * reportbug now runs if readline cannot be imported.
  * Tab-completion is now supported at some prompts if the readline module
    can be imported.  This affects the severity prompt and the packages
    prompt at the moment.  (Closes: #81496, #82843)
  * Leading and trailing spaces on input are now stripped.  This shouldn't
    hurt anything, and makes tab completion behave nicely.
  * Complies to policy 3.2.1.0, no changes necessary.

  * Add "minor" severity, not that I can find any documentation of its
    existence...  (Closes: #76665)
  * #75137 was fixed in 1.1 (same as #68681, I think).  (Closes: #75137)
  * Remove support for the TDYC bug tracking system, since KDE2 is in
    Debian now and the BTS there has been shut down.  (Closes: #77335)
  * Add support for the Origin and Bugs headers.  (Closes: #76669)
    Origin probably works well, Bugs probably doesn't do what you want it
    to yet (it can report to the server, but I'm almost certain it won't
    query the right server).
  * BTSes found in /etc/dpkg/origins/* will be added to the BTS list
    automatically.  Any Bugs: line other than debbugs URLs will probably not
    work, however.
  * Some internal architecture support for reporting to GNATS.  It isn't
    all there yet, so unless you want to see tracebacks tread lightly.
  * #62338 is not a bug; see the -i option.  (Closes: #62338)
  * Incredible hackery to avoid weird issues when your cwd gets deleted in
    the middle of running reportbug.  (Closes: #77954)

  * LDAP is no longer the default system for communicating with the BTS.
    Config files changed accordingly.
  * '-l' means '--ldap' now, which actually makes more sense.
  * We now use the cgi interface to the Debian BTS if available.  This

  * I tried to work around #63970 ("weird behavior on sparc"), please test.
  * Don't fork 'tty' every time we print something.

    It uses a file /usr/share/doc/{package}/Debian.bugtemplate, which

  * querybts: don't crash when a bug requested by number can't be
    found. (Closes: #56296)
  * querybts: don't go funky when launching a text-mode browser from a
    numbered report.
  * reportbug: disallowed sending the report if it's unmodified; tried to
    work around cases where the editor is backgrounded.  (Closes: #56339)
  * Added support for Mandrake's debbugs system (as "mandrake").
  * Close spurious bug report caused while submitter was testing bug fixes
    to #56523.  (Closes: #56521)

reportbug (0.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * Properly report forwarded bugs when using the LDAP database.
  * Interrupt in querybts actually works right, now.
  * Note that 'querybts -w' will show the full story behind a bug report
    in the man page.  Also added an option to launch a browser from the
    bug report page.  (Closes: #49156)
  * Fixed "missing screens when in xterm/rxvt" problem in querybts.
    (Closes: #49151)
  * Import readline to avoid problems with keyboard stuff.  (Closes: #51337)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Jan 2000 12:25:22 -0600

reportbug (0.47) unstable; urgency=low

  * reportbug now works without python-ldap; downgrade python-ldap to a
    suggestion, since it brings in lots of bloat packages and is of
    priority extra.
  * Remove suggestion of mail-reader.  Specific mail readers
    (af, mutt, nmh, mh) permit extra features, but all of them don't.
  * Added word "new" to clean up a message.  (Closes: #54030)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue,  4 Jan 2000 06:24:45 -0600

  * Work-around apparent bug in python-ldap.  (Closes: #52459, #52467, #52474)
  * "Extra info" option in reportbug is now 'i', not 'x'.  (Closes: #52308)
  * You can now enter a bug number at the "Is the bug you found..."
    prompt. (Closes: #52309)
  * Cleaned up Ctrl-C exit from querybts.

reportbug (0.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Declare dependency on whiptail.  (Really Closes: #51682)
  * Upgrade python-newt to dependency, since querybts seems ready for
    prime-time (despite a few cosmetic bugs).

reportbug (0.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Back out change in 0.42 that broke reportbug if you didn't have a 
    "real name".  (Closes: #50378)
  * Don't try to get input in find_package_for() if we don't have a TTY.
    Instead, list matching package names.  (Closes: #50622)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Nov 1999 10:22:36 -0600

reportbug (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * You can now configure your email address, etc., using
    /etc/reportbug.conf or ~/.reportbugrc.
  * "Internal" mailer support.  (Closes: #50155)
  * You can now set a number of parameters on the command line that
    previously were set in the environment.
  * Fix bugs introduced when changing querybts to use the mirror list from
    the configuration file.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Nov 1999 15:11:43 -0600

reportbug (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Close LDAP connection after query module is no longer needed.
    (Closes: #49085)
  * querybts now supports entering a bug number at the command line.
    (Closes: #49155)
  * 'querybts -w' emulates the bugview script from "bug".  (Closes: #48360)
  * #48457 is due to the debbugs software, not reportbug, and is a feature
    of its nightly rebuild of its web pages.  (Closes: #48457)
  * querybts now respects the mirrors list from /etc/reportbug.conf
  * Reports that are too wide in querybts are now truncated at the right,
    instead of the left.  (Closes: #49150).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Nov 1999 14:04:53 -0600

reportbug (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Much better message if querybts can't run because python-newt is not
    installed.  python-newt will become a dependency of the package when
    reportbug includes the newt interface too.  (Closes: #48792)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Oct 1999 11:19:18 -0600

reportbug (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copes better with bad/missing input in the BTS query interface.
    (Closes: #48009)
  * Better exit messages than "Aborted."  (Closes: #48615)
  * If ^C is pressed to exit, get something better-looking than a Python
    stack dump.  (Closes: #48694)
  * Now include the (somewhat incomplete) querybts program; add
    appropriate suggestion for python-newt.  (Closes: #44805)
  * No longer dies if configuration files can't be opened.
  * More informative error message if a conf file can't be read.
    (Closes: #48710)

  * Removed "fixed" from the severities menu.  You can still submit
    "fixed" bugs, but the option is now invisible.  (Closes: #47863)
  * You can submit more information about an outstanding bug from the
    query interface, using 'x' (for "extra information").
    (Closes: #47868)
  * Bug reports can be signed with either GnuPG (--gpg) or PGP (-pgp).
    You can also automatically do this (using /etc/reportbug.conf or
    ~/.reportbugrc) if desired (sign gpg|pgp).
    (cfr. "bug" wishlist item #45779)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Oct 1999 02:13:59 -0500

reportbug (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle BTSes with mirrors; use the config file to set the priority
    ordering if desired.  (No mirror listing will lead to the default
    behavior.)  (Closes: #47488)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Oct 1999 23:34:10 -0500

reportbug (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

reportbug (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I'm headed to ALS and therefore need to get my affairs in order"
    release.  (OK, so it's not as cool as the libc release names; sue me).
  * If a special package name format is used by a BTS, use that format
    string to form queries of that BTS.  Specifically, it will sort-of
    merge the results of a query for "package" and the formatted package
    name.  [This only affects the TDYC server at present, since it's the
    only one that uses these query strings.]  (Closes: #47396)
  * A preliminary console BTS browser has been written; however, I'm
    waiting on the new newt packages to move out of Incoming before
    including it.  (Does anyone know how/if it's possible to get a newt
    text box to scroll horizontally?  That's the biggest remaining
    obstacle to having a good interface.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Oct 1999 02:12:33 -0500

reportbug (0.34) unstable; urgency=low

reportbug (0.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * You can now disable LDAP access (--no-ldap).
  * Fallback to HTTP access if LDAP access generates an exception
    (i.e. if connection is refused by an LDAP server).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Oct 1999 19:22:59 -0500

reportbug (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * debianbts.py now supports LDAP queries; only the "Debian" BTS uses
    this feature so far.  This helps ensure that you are aware of the current
    state of the BTS.  (Further addresses #40115)  LDAP access to Debian
    seems faster, particularly for getting the text of reports.
  * Modules are now installed in /usr/lib/site-python (version-independent
    Python module directory in Debian).  This way other packages can use
    them (I think the API is more-or-less stable).
  * Proper message if you query a specific report and it's not available.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Oct 1999 22:22:36 -0500

reportbug (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * --output now cancels out --print.
  * If 'stty size' returns '0 0', set reasonable defaults.  (For use in
    emacs' M-x shell).
  * Shared files now in /usr/share/reportbug.
  * Changes to reportbug.realpath() to not fully resolve certain FHS
    directories that may be local symlinks.  (Closes: #44932)
    (These are top-level directories specified by FSSTND and FHS that
    may be symlinked by local administrators to distribute files over

reportbug (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Code cleanups to make reportbug less Debian- and debbugs-centric.
  * Calls with -B {gnome,kde} bypass the Debian package manager and don't
    put the Debian release or architecture in the report.
  * Bugs sent to tdyc now have their package field append '-debian', to
    better reflect TDYC's tracking policies.  (Closes: #44000)

reportbug (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that made reportbug claim all conffiles were modified,
    even if they weren't. (Closes: #43871)
  * Now distinguishes between pseudo-headers and other headers (like
    X-Debian-CC:) in reports.  Pseudo-headers are reordered if necessary
    so they appear in the sequence: Package, Version, Severity, File.
    (Closes: #43868)
  * Fiddled around with the man page somewhat.  If it's 4 pages long, it's
    not "briefly" documenting anything anymore.

reportbug (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

reportbug (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't crash if we can't query the BTS. (Closes: #43056)
  * Now supports a simple rc file in /etc/reportbug.conf or ~/.reportbugrc
    (with the contents of the latter overriding the contents of the
    former).  See man page for details.  (Closes: #42774)

  * Warn if you're reporting a bug in a non-existant package.
  * Don't crash if you're reporting a bug in a virtual package.

  * Mention $http_proxy on the man page. (Closes: #41982)
  * Provide info on packages providing virtual packages. (Closes: #42024)
  * Package listing reformatted to provide this info.  The provided
    package appears in brackets after the name.

    Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho. (Closes: #41332)
  * Support alternate debbugs servers, using new --bts (-B) option.
    Defaults to 'debian'; also supports 'tdyc' (or 'kde').  For
    example, to report a bug in kdebase use 'reportbug -B kde kdebase'.
    Feel free to add/suggest support for other debbugs servers.
    Suggestion by Achim Bohnet. (Closes: #41374)

reportbug (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed man page to document --no-bts-query (-b).
  * Dependency modified until unstable picks up the python 1.5.2-4 upload
    for non-PowerPC architectures; avoid using versioned dependencies on
    packages obsoleted by 1.5.2-4 to make Gregor's life easier.
  * Alias sys.stderr.write() -> ewrite()
  * No greportbug yet (sorry X fans).

reportbug (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed several popen() calls to use the 'commands' module;
    makes for much cleaner code.

  * Properly handle the case where some, but not all, conffiles have been
    removed.
  * List outstanding bug reports on the package to help maintain sanity
    of developers; new option --no-bts-query (-b) added for offline use.
    (Closes: #40115)

                      reports, etc.
      - debianbts.py: querying the BTS proper (nifty HTML parser).

    . $DEBEMAIL will be used before $EMAIL for an address (i.e. x@y.org)
    . $DEBNAME or $NAME will be used before $USERNAME for the "real name"
      part of the address.  If neither is available, will use the real
      name from /etc/passwd.
  * Quoting of real names is now done in accordance with RFC 822.

  * Rearranged the code so options are processed before figuring out your
    email address.
  * Fixed bug #38541 (reportbug fails calling exim's /usr/sbin/sendmail).
  * Corollary: if your /usr/sbin/sendmail fails, the bug report will be
    saved as if you had no MTA.
  * Don't warn about sending configuration files if it's only because a
    conffile has been removed.
  * --filename (-f) option now handles files with symbolic links in their
    pathnames. (cfr. #23821 [bug])
  * --mutt (-M) option allows you to use mutt instead of an editor to file
    bug reports.  (cfr. #10837 [bug])
  * --af (-a) is similar, but uses the af mail reader.
  * --nmh and --mh (-n) is also similar, but uses the "comp" command from
    mh/nmh.
  * --mua allows you to do this with any mail reader that can edit draft
    messages specified on the command line.  (However, send me anything
    needed for other editors, please!)

reportbug (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed virtual package date format to YYYY-MM-DD; per request from
    Jim Van Zandt on debian-devel.
  * Added a message to the report if modified configuration files were
    omitted at the user's request.
  * It's now always verbose; useful on slower systems (so you can tell
