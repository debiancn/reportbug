This file is lifted, almost verbatim, from "bug".

                      BUG'S Features for Developers
		      =============================


 Bug allows maintainers to control the bug reporting process by placing
files in special places.

Template Information & Interaction with the user
================================================

 If /usr/share/bug/$package is executable, then bug executes it and
takes what comes out from the file descriptor 3 and puts it in the bug
template.
 The maintainer can then ask questions to the user or run whatever
information gathering script he likes, and echo all the content to fd 3.

 e.g.:
	read -p 'color? '
	echo "Color: $REPLY" >&3
	...
	system-information-tool >&3
	
 If /usr/share/bug/$package is a directory, then
/usr/share/bug/$package/script is executed.

 While the script is executed, the following shell functions are
available:

	getkey				- asks for a key
	yesno <prompt> "yep"|"nop"	- ask for a yes/no answer (with i18n)
					  leaves response as yep or nop
					  in REPLY. The second argument is
					  the default.

 If the file /usr/share/bug/$package/presubj exists, its content is
shown to the user before asking him for the bug's subject.

 Note: It's your responsibility to check if the information included
in the template can put the user in any security risk.

Package redirection
===================

 The package maintainer can control to which packages are the bug reports
submitted to (i.e. the Package: field of the report). This will be mainly
used to redirect bugs in packages coming from a single source to where the
maintainer likes to have them.

 This is done by having this line in /usr/share/bug/$package/control
	Submit-As: $new-package

 Note that bug will not check if the $new-package exists as a valid package.

BTS selection
=============

 Packages not distributed by Debian can take advantage of this utility too.
They just need to add a "send-to" header to the control file
/usr/share/bug/$package/control.

	Send-To: bugs.myproject.com

 `bug' will add `submit@' `quiet@' or `maintonly@' to form the address the
bug report mail is send to.

(Note: you probably should use dpkg's support for Origin and Bugs tags
in lieu of this support.)

Addendum: Languages other than SH
=================================

The script in /usr/share/bug/reportbug/script is an example of a bug
handling script written in Python.  You can also write bug handlers in
many other languages that allow direct access to file descriptors,
including Perl and C/C++.
