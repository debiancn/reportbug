Common issues with reportbug:

EMAIL ADDRESS SETTING: See the manual page reportbug(1) for how to set
   your email address (i.e. the address that appears in the "From:"
   header), if reportbug is unable to correctly figure it out for you.

   Note that some mail systems will further rewrite the address
   displayed by reportbug when it starts.

EDITORS: See the manual page reportbug(1) for how to choose an editor.
   You probably will want to have this setting for other tools as
   well.  As an alternative, some mail programs, such as "mutt", can
   be configured to be used as the editor for your report, which you
   may find preferable.
